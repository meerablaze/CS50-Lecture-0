In this website, I've shown all the different Eurostar destinations and made it easier to find out more and book tickets.
My index.html page mainly uses HTML code and uses CSS for the links.
Intro.html uses bootstrap for the table and a mixture of bootstap and CSS for the icon.
The stysle sheet uses CSS and SCSS.
I have used CSS for links, fonts, boreders, forms and icons. I have used all 5 CSS selectors.
